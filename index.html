            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, my name is Clement. I am currently building web applications using the <strong>Flask</strong> framework. My first exposure to web development was in 2020 during the corona virus epidemic when I came across web a developement add on Youtube. Fast forward to 2021, I decided to sacrifice part of my leisure period to learn this new skill and here I am today. I would like to think that I have learned a lot since then. I am a <strong>Python</strong> developer and also know <strong>C</strong>, <strong>JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. I can design and manage databases in <strong>SQLite</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostGreSQL</strong> too. Check out some of my work and feel free to send me an email if you would like us to work together.</p>

                <p>
                    This Python project serves as a GPA calculator tailored for Science students. It efficiently computes the Grade Point Average (GPA) by processing exam scores from key subjects such as Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and English. The program extracts student information, including their names and respective scores, from the "students.csv" file. Upon execution, the program takes "students.csv" and the designated student's name as command-line arguments, enabling seamless GPA calculation for individual students.</p>
